我的答辩

1.  根据我对继承法的基本理解，子女对父母遗产的继承是根据血缘关系及赡养关系这两点，而不是根据陪伴时间的长短. 

2.  我虽然有五年时间因病而滞留美国，但在此之前我为我父亲的健康问题所付出的代价绝不比杜霞少，而是更多. 

3.  举例说明我在2009－2010留京期间，为照料我父亲而做的工作. 

I. 联系当时的卫生部党委书记张茅，促成我父亲住院治疗，避免了我父亲因突发吸入性肺炎而死亡. 
虽然张茅的父亲和我父亲是老战友，但过去我和杜霞都不认识他. 因此颇费一番周折，我才与他联系上. 张茅对我父亲的事很热心帮忙，表示在看病方面有问题，随时可以与他联系. 因此在我父亲因吸入性肺炎发烧而就诊于北京医院，无法入住呼吸科病房时，我给张茅办公室打了电话. 随后，我父亲得以入住呼吸科病房，并且北京医院院长带着呼吸科水平最高的一位副主任（平时我们根本见不到）来探视我父亲并根据X光片立刻诊断出我父亲患有吸入性肺炎. 这是其他医生做不到. 此后在治疗的基础上监控我父亲的喝水与饮食. 

吸入性肺炎的危险之处在于：如果患者不知道自己有此问题，仍然采取和正常人同样的方式喝水与吃饭，水和食物都有可能不通过食道而是进入气管吸入肺里， 引起大面积肺内感染，失去抢救的可能，导致患者死亡. 

在没有得到张茅店帮助之前，我父亲在北京医院看病和住院，都没有得到正确的诊断. 

II. 请王岐山同志帮助解决我父亲在北京医院住院和治疗问题，使我父亲得以在北京医院住院五年，直至去世. 

2009年，我父亲已九十七岁高龄，患有多种疾病，但他一心一意要活到一百岁. 他的合同医院是北京医院，可是我父亲生病时经常得不到正确诊断而被拒绝住院治疗. 即使得到卫生部张茅书记的帮助，高干门诊办公室仍然坚持不允许我父亲长期住院，而要把我父亲转到北京中日友好医院. 这所医院的诊疗水平和住院条件都不如北京医院. 我母亲就是在这所医院因医疗事故而死亡，所以我坚决不同意我父亲转院. 

恰好在此之前我给王岐山同志写了一封信，陈述了我父亲在北京医院遇到的种种困难，请王岐山同志给予帮助. 
于是王岐山同志于2010年十月国庆节假期专门到北京医院看望了我父亲. 从此我父亲背景在北京医院连续住院五年，而且得到了很好的照顾，活到了一百零二岁. 

综上所述，张茅和王岐山两位同志的帮助促使我父亲能够得到正确的诊断和良好的治疗，以及最终寿命超过了百岁. 他们所起的作用是我们子女起不到的. 

在我生病滞留美国五年间，王岐山同志多次去北京医院看望我父亲，保证了我父亲能持续住院并得到良好的照顾，从而满足了我父亲的心愿，达到了高寿而终. 

在我和这两位领导同志联系之前，他们都不知晓我父亲在北京医院所遇到的种种困难. 因此我感到欣慰，我在父亲的晚年尽到了作为一个女儿应尽的全部义务. 同时，我也为我不在北京期间杜霞照顾我父亲奠定了良好的基础.
